# ForgeFlow Documentation

This folder contains the long-form technical documentation for operators and contributors.

## Contents

- [Architecture](./ARCHITECTURE.md): system components, data flow, storage model, reliability controls.
- [API Reference](./API_REFERENCE.md): complete HTTP and WebSocket endpoints with auth/permission requirements and examples.
- [Deployment Guide](./DEPLOYMENT.md): local/prod deployment steps, hardening checklist, and Kubernetes starter manifests.
- [Contributing Guide](./CONTRIBUTING.md): development setup, testing workflow, coding standards, and contribution process.

Recent UX baseline:
- Quick-add node search in toolbar (`Ctrl/Cmd+K`) is a core workflow path and should remain covered in manual QA.
- Autopilot prompt-to-workflow flow is a core low-code path and should remain covered in manual QA.
